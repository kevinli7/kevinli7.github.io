	        		Since the prompt was very flexible for the medium we were allowed to present in, I chose to
	        		try and take a more unique approach by applying the skills I have learned in my major (Computer Science) to this
	        		assignment. As a quick introduction, I am a fourth year at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science who 
	        		will be working as a Software Engineer after graduation. I am also working at ICSI as an undergraduate researcher where
	        		I mainly focus on Computer Vision but also work with other students who focus on audio. Through discussions with
	        		those students and classes I have learned a few things about audio processing which I will apply to Blue Cathedral by 
	        		Jennifer Higdon. All code used in this assignment is available 
	        		<a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinli7/kevinli7.github.io/master/data/visualize_music.py'>here</a>.

	        	<h3>Details About the Piece</h3>
	        	<img id="spect" src="images/melspectBC.png" title="Mel-Spectrogram of Blue Cathedral.">
	        	<p class='caption'> Mel power spectrogram of Blue Cathedral.  Through this we can get a glimpse of the major sections of the piece.</p>
	        	<p>
	        		I decided to take the music file and create a mel-scaled power spectrogram for the piece, which is pictured above. Mel-frequency based 
	        		features are very powerful for speech recognition and are gaining popularity in in tasks such as genre classification, which is why I have
	        		chosen to do a mel-scaled spectrogram. For anyone who is unfamiliar, a spectrogram visualizes the amplitude (color) of different frequencies (y-axis)
	        		by time (x-axis). Through this spectrogram, it is immediately obvious that there are some distinct sections in the piece. The spectrogram indicates 
	        		there is a louder and deeper section at around 3 minutes and 6 minutes, which a thorough listening quickly confirms.
	        		<br>
	        		Before going into a more detailed breakdown of the song. The song features two soloists, a flute and a clarinet, which have a dialogue throughout the piece.
	        		The orchestra provides background and transitionary sections much like sonata forms we have studied before.  The whole piece has a feeling of floating or drifting
	        		with some darker sections played by the orchestra that may represent turmoil or grief.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>0:00 - </b> The piece begins with a chime like metallic percussion instrument. To me this part sounds like chimes blowing in the wind or
	        		bells ringing in the distance.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>0:13 - </b> Violins come in playing a two-note downward stepping figure. The notes are gentle giving me the impression of a leaf floating
	        		around gently in the wind or even the violins symbolizing the wind.  Some deeper percussion joins in with the violins around the 40 second mark.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>0:45- </b> Flutes come in and begin their solo with woodwinds and strings playing quietly in the background. The flute's melody seems to be wandering
	        		around but there is no clear direction.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>1:30 - </b> The orchestra joins in more and with the flute, this section feels like it is lifting you up. 
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>1:57 - </b> At this point the clarinet joins in and the two soloists start to begin a dialogue, either playing together or taking turns but together
	        		they build to the... 
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>3:00 - </b> Climax! The climax builds together with a low, thunderous rumbling from the timpanis and brass instruments playing a fanfare.  The flute and
	        		clarinet joined by the strings play sort of a sharp, almost eerie theme on top of the rest of the orchestra. This sounds like a grief-filled turmoil.  The 
	        		low rumbling of the timpanis and the brass may represent a sense of unease.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>4:20 - </b> The climax ends and the orchestra quiets down a bit with the clarinets returning as the primary soloists. 
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>4:50 - </b> The oboe starts at this section playing a slow, low, almost-ominous theme. At 5:25 the violins join in with the cellos following
	        		suit at 5:35.  Together these three instruments, play a lower theme on top of which the clarinets and flutes play a more shrill, higher theme which slowly
	        		builds to a darker seciton.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>6:13 - </b> This deeper section is less of the climax as before, but has the same darker background played by the orchestra with bass drums playing periodically
	        		and the brass section rumbling.  In the middle of the section, the flute can be heard through the darker sections palying a staccatto theme. The orchestra starts to 
	        		build into a darker section.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>7:25 - </b> This section is more rushed with percussion playing a low rumbling theme, and the brass horns blaring out powerful notes. The strings play a musical
	        		motive of 3 quick notes which gives the section a rushed feeling. This section seems to be a mix between a military section from the fanfare of notes played by the brass
	        		and a more troubled confused section indicated by an uneven tempo and rhythm.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>8:20 - </b> Brass sections plays quick rapid fire notes centering around a single pitch, later joined in by the woodwinds.  The orchestra joins in at 8:45 with
	        		their own theme.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>9:30 - </b> These themes build to a climax which sounds like the end. But instead of getting what we expect (dissonance), we anti-climatically return back to the theme in the beginning. The piece returns to the two soloists and until the end of the song it sounds very much like the beginning. The ending however differs at around
	        		11:47 with instead of just the chime/bell like sounds, the piano comes in repeatedly playing a single note.
	        	</p>
	        	TODO(Kevin): Talk about how this is sort of a flight of emotions marked by grief.
