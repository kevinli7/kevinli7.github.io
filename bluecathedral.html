	        		Since the prompt was very flexible for the medium we were allowed to present in, I chose to
	        		try and take a more unique approach by applying the skills I have learned in my major (Computer Science) to this
	        		assignment. As a quick introduction, I am a fourth year at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science who 
	        		will be working as a Software Engineer after graduation. I am also working at ICSI as an undergraduate researcher where
	        		I mainly focus on Computer Vision but also work with other students who focus on audio. Through discussions with
	        		those students and classes I have learned a few things about audio processing which I will apply to <i>Blue Cathedral</i> by 
	        		Jennifer Higdon. All code used in this assignment is available 
	        		<a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinli7/kevinli7.github.io/master/data/visualize_music.py'>here</a>.

	        	<h3>Details About the Piece</h3>
	        	<img id="spect" src="images/melspectBC.png" title="Mel-Spectrogram of Blue Cathedral.">
	        	<p class='caption'> Mel power spectrogram of Blue Cathedral.  Through this we can get a glimpse of the major sections of the piece.</p>
	        	<p>
	        		I decided to take the music file and create a mel-scaled power spectrogram for the piece, which is pictured above. Mel-frequency based 
	        		features are very powerful for speech recognition and are gaining popularity in in tasks such as genre classification, which is why I have
	        		chosen to do a mel-scaled spectrogram. For anyone who is unfamiliar, a spectrogram visualizes the amplitude (color) of different frequencies (y-axis)
	        		by time (x-axis). Through this spectrogram, it is immediately obvious that there are some distinct sections in the piece. The spectrogram indicates 
	        		there is a louder and deeper section at around 3 minutes and 6 minutes, which a thorough listening quickly confirms.
	        		<br>
	        		Before going into a more detailed breakdown of the song. The song features two soloists, a flute and a clarinet, which have a dialogue throughout the piece.
	        		The orchestra provides background and transitionary sections much like sonata forms we have studied before.  The whole piece has a feeling of floating or drifting
	        		with some darker sections played by the orchestra that may represent turmoil or grief.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>0:00 - </b> The piece begins with a chime like metallic percussion instrument. To me this part sounds like chimes blowing in the wind or
	        		bells ringing in the distance.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>0:13 - </b> Violins come in playing a two-note downward stepping figure. The notes are gentle giving me the impression of a leaf floating
	        		around gently in the wind or even the violins symbolizing the wind.  Some deeper percussion joins in with the violins around the 40 second mark.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>0:45- </b> Flutes come in and begin their solo with woodwinds and strings playing quietly in the background. The flute's melody seems to be wandering
	        		around but there is no clear direction.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>1:30 - </b> The orchestra joins in more and with the flute, this section feels like it is lifting you up. 
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>1:57 - </b> At this point the clarinet joins in and the two soloists start to begin a dialogue, either playing together or taking turns but together
	        		they build to the... 
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>3:00 - </b> Climax! The climax builds together with a low, thunderous rumbling from the timpanis and brass instruments playing a fanfare.  The flute and
	        		clarinet joined by the strings play sort of a sharp, almost eerie theme on top of the rest of the orchestra. This sounds like a grief-filled turmoil.  The 
	        		low rumbling of the timpanis and the brass may represent a sense of unease.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>4:20 - </b> The climax ends and the orchestra quiets down a bit with the clarinets returning as the primary soloists. 
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>4:50 - </b> The oboe starts at this section playing a slow, low, almost-ominous theme. At 5:25 the violins join in with the cellos following
	        		suit at 5:35.  Together these three instruments, play a lower theme on top of which the clarinets and flutes play a more shrill, higher theme which slowly
	        		builds to a darker seciton.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>6:13 - </b> This deeper section is less of the climax as before, but has the same darker background played by the orchestra with bass drums playing periodically
	        		and the brass section rumbling.  In the middle of the section, the flute can be heard through the darker sections palying a staccatto theme. The orchestra starts to 
	        		build into a darker section.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>7:25 - </b> This section is more rushed with percussion playing a low rumbling theme, and the brass horns blaring out powerful notes. The strings play a musical
	        		motive of 3 quick notes which gives the section a rushed feeling. This section seems to be a mix between a military section from the fanfare of notes played by the brass
	        		and a more troubled confused section indicated by an uneven tempo and rhythm.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>8:20 - </b> Brass sections plays quick rapid fire notes centering around a single pitch, later joined in by the woodwinds.  The orchestra joins in at 8:45 with
	        		their own theme.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		<b>9:30 - </b> These themes build to a climax which sounds like the end. But instead of getting what we expect (dissonance), we anti-climatically return back to the theme in the beginning. The piece returns to the two soloists and until the end of the song it sounds very much like the beginning. The ending however differs at around
	        		11:47 with instead of just the chime/bell like sounds, the piano comes in repeatedly playing a single note.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		From the title and beginning of the song with the chime/bell like sounds, one might think that this piece is similar to program music that just intends to
	        		depict something with musical themes. But upon a closer listening, a dialogue between the flute and clarinet reveals itself. Either in conversation or speaking
	        		together. However, with the orchestral parts at three and six minutes in, we get a vastly different section where the orchestra plays and deep and rumbling musical theme.
	        		These sections are somewhat uneasing and troubling. It's like a building up of grief and pain almost.  There are a lot of different sections of the orchestra playing all
	        		at once all battling for attention. I've <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2/">read</a> that the 
	        		grief of loss is often something that hits you in waves, sometimes coming suddenly and vanishing just as quickly. In this piece there are two sections where the orchestra
	        		plays a dark and ominous tune that I believe represents grief. And just as quickly as they come they go away, even more remarkably so in the second section where
	        		the orchestral section very unexpectedly fades away into the two soloists playing. The piece is meant as a dedication to Jennifer Higdon's late brother.
	        		With this knowledge, the piece quickly ties together and the emotion packed into the piece becomes even more apparent.

	        	<h2>How this relates to other music we've studied</h2>
	        	<img id="t-SNE" src="images/tsnevis.png" title="t-SNE embedding of different songs.">
	        	<p class='caption'> 
	        		 t-SNE visualization of MFCC (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) features calculated on one second frames of songs of different musical periods.
	        	</p>
	        	<!-- Plotly chart will be drawn inside this DIV -->
						<div id="3d t-SNE" style="width:100%;height:100%"></div>
						<p class='caption'> 
	        		 3D t-SNE visualization of MFCC (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) features calculated on one second frames of songs of different musical periods.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		Part of the prompt asks us to talk about similarities between our chosen piece and other pieces of music we've studied. Using techniques from
	        		machine learning research, I have made a simplistic visualization of similarities between the piece and the genres.  As I mentioned above,
	        		MFCC (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) features are becoming a standard type of feature used in many machine learning tasks such as speech recognition
	        		or genre classification.  This means that these features can capture some intrinsic quality about the music which can identify genres.  However, this data
	        		ends up being relatively high-dimensional so it can be hard to visualize these features and how they compare. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) 
	        		is a technique for taking high dimensional data and embedding it into a lower dimensional space. In other words, it can be used to visualize high 
	        		dimensional features in a lower dimensional space with the idea being that similar features in the higher dimensional space will be closer together in the low
	        		dimensional space.  I took 1 second frames of each song and calculated MFCC features from these frames and then selected 100 of these features randomly from each song
	        		and mapped them to 2D and 3D spaces to visualize similarities between <i>Blue Cathedral</i> and other genres we have studied.  The obvious limitation is I am
	        		comparing 1 second frames intead of the whole songs, but these one second frames can capture a surprising amount of information about music. Above I have a 2D scatter plot
	        		and a 3D scatter plot (which is interactive!) of these embeddings.  The 2D one is a lot easier to see and view than the 3D plot, but I thought the 3D plot was fun to play with.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		From the 2D scatter plot, I see points representing <i>Blue Cathedral</i> clustered around lots of classical and romantic points.  There are some sections that are similar
	        		to 20th and 21st century music but a lot seems to be around classical and romantic.  I find this to be particularly interesting because before I made these plots, these are the eras 
	        		of music I thought this piece had lots of similarities to.  Perhaps they are close to these other genres in this graph because of similar instrumentation and music,
	        		but the reason I think these genres are similar to <i>Blue Cathedral</i> is because of the form for classical and the individualism/emotion of romantic music.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		Sonata form was created during the Classical era. Sonata form is strutured as an exposition with two themes, a development section and a recapitulation which is 
	        		basically (and way oversimplified) a repeat of the exposition. In this piece, it begins with a theme played by the flute and clarinet, either separately or together.  This
	        		introductory theme is also brought back again at the end, but what I find more interesting is the parts in the middle.  In sandwich between these two repeated themes, there is
	        		sort of a transitionary theme played by the whole orchestra and the soloists that represent grief, a middle, quieter section that features a build up with oboes, violins, and 
	        		cellos into the another darker section that represents grief.  While this is obviously not sonata form, I believe there are similarities in that it has a repetitive beggining and end,
	        		dialogue between two soloists, and the piece as a whole telling a story about loss and love. 
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		The story about loss and love brings me into the ties of Romanticism.  The Romantic era was characteristic in it's expression of emotions and ties to nature. The whole piece is
	        		a grief filled dedication to a lost brother. This emotion is shown by the meandering, almost-lost melody of the clarinets and flutes and the dark, rumbling sections played by
	        		the orchestra in the middle. These dark rumbling sections remind me of a (perhaps metaphorical) thunderstorm that may be representative of the dark and stormy feelings caused
	        		by the loss of a loved one.  This would be similar to the representation of nature that is very present in the Romantic music.
	        	</p>

	        	<h2>My Personal Reaction</h2>
	        	<p>
	        		During my first listen to the piece, I thought it was a nice melody (which reminded me of the opening song of Good Will Hunting a little bit), but the song seemed to have little
	        		structure and the melody seemed to be wandering aimlessly. The darker section played by the orchestra as a whole took me a little by surprise (which may be the intended effect). 
	        		I thought the piece was very beautiful but wasn't entirely sure what to think about it.  After a few more listens, I did some research on the piece to find the motivation
	        		of the piece and found some program notes by the composer which to me revealed a lot about the piece (I personally believe program notes to be very useful in revealing
	        		the true nature of a song unlike Schumann).  I started to see how the solos represent one's journey through life; the melody's aimless wandering is analagous to life taking you
	        		wherever it will. The darker orchestral sections represent the grief of the loss of ones brother, but potentially also the darker and more uncertain parts of life.  And what I found
	        		incredibly beautiful was the flute dropping out near the end and having the clarinet finish the song.  Clarinet was the instrument that Higdon's brother played and one can see it as
	        		Jennifer Higdon portraying her brother's journey past the end of his life.
	        	</p>
	        	<p>
	        		I ended up finding the song to be very enjoyable, and filled with meaning with some more active listening. The flute and clarinet's dialogue seemed to me like a final conversation
	        		between Higdon and her brother. The strings and woodwinds gave a floating feeling to the piece, while the percussion and brass kept the piece grounded and created some urgency.  Overall,
	        		I thought the piece was beautifully composed and conveys all the ideas that the composer wanted to get through.
