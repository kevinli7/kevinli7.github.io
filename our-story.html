                    <p>Kevin and Sabrina first met at a local coffee shop in 2020. What started as a casual conversation over lattes quickly blossomed into something beautiful. We spent hours talking about our dreams, our favorite books, and our shared love for adventure.</p>
                    <p>That first meeting felt like we had known each other forever. The connection was instant and undeniable.</p>

                    <p>We discovered that we both love hiking, cooking together, and watching the sunset. Our shared interests and values brought us even closer.</p>

                    <p>On a perfect summer evening, Kevin planned a surprise picnic at our favorite park where we had our first date. As the sun was setting, he got down on one knee and asked Sabrina to spend the rest of her life with him.</p>
                    <p>Sabrina said yes without hesitation! The moment was filled with tears of joy, laughter, and overwhelming love. It was the beginning of our forever.</p>
