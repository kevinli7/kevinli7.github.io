                    <p>In the Fall of 2019, Kevin and Sabrina met on Hinge, where a picture of Kevin in a pink apron caught Sabrina's eye</p>
                    <p>They talked a lot and kept discovering more and more things in common (such as having the same drawing tablet) and eventually
                        went on their first date at Santana Row (RIP Amazon Books).

                    <p>
                        Things were going well, but then the Covid pandemic happened and we
                        went a few months without seeing each other. This period was tough,
                        but solidifed our relationship through long hours of playing Stardew Valley.
                        and Animal Crossing virtually together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually, life became normal again and we were able go on many memorable dates
                        and trips together.

                    <p>
                        One of our favorite weekend getaway locations is Monterey, having gone multiple times throughout the years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In October of 2024, Kevin planned a *casual* trip to Monterey. During the trip, we enjoyed
                        the ocean vibes and the aquarium before Kevin proposed to Sabrina at the Spa. Kevin hid the ring
                        inside a Sonny Angel box and we have a unboxing video to prove it (ask Sabrina if you want to see it).
