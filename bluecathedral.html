	        		Since the prompt was very flexible for the medium we were allowed to present in, I chose to
	        		try and take a more unique approach by applying the skills I have learned in my major (Computer Science) to this
	        		assignment. As a quick introduction, I am a fourth year at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science who 
	        		will be working as a Software Engineer after graduation. I am also working at ICSI as an undergraduate researcher where
	        		I mainly focus on Computer Vision but also work with other students who focus on audio. Through discussions with
	        		those students and classes I have learned a few things about audio processing which I will apply to Blue Cathedral by 
	        		Jennifer Higdon. All code used in this assignment is available 
	        		<a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinli7/kevinli7.github.io/master/data/visualize_music.py'>here</a>.
