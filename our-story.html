                    <h2>How We Met</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the fall of 2019, Kevin and Sabrina first met through the most magical (and modern)
                        interaction you could ever imagine — a hinge dating profile. Kevin was smitten over Sabrina’s
                        smile in a sunny photo, while Kevin first caught Sabrina's eye proudly wearing a pink apron.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What first started off as a conversation about shows led to conversations about shared
                        interests and chance coincidences (like having the same drawing tablet at the same time!). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This eventually led to their first date in Santana Row, where Kevin and Sabrina bonded
                        over an interaction with a man buying a $600+ pen at Maido, laughing over a book about
                        ridiculous birds (RIP Amazon Books), and talking about Kevin’s childhood glory days  in Mathletes.

                    <h2>Early Dating</h2>
                    <p>
                        4 months into their relationship, the pandemic occurred, and they went almost as many months
                        apart than they were together. However, their relationship kept going through long hours of 
                        Stardew Valley, Sabrina watching Kevin play animal crossing for hours (until Kevin shared his 
                        switch with her) and multiple Facebook messenger calls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually, life became anew and they were able to spend 4+ years together without the distance of a screen.

                    <p>
                        Big moments into their relationship included their trip together to Seattle, Hawaii, and 
                        Japan 2x, staycations in California, and multiple days cozying at home. Their relationship 
                        persisted through their love of food and cooking, cozy movie nights, or a new craft (or several) 
                        suggested by Sabrina. Today, you will most likely see them both watching their comfort shows, 
                        making each other a sweet treat, and laughing about silly cat noises.

                    <h2>The Proposal</h2>
                    <p>
                        Monterey Bay would definitely be considered one of Kevin and Sabrina’s favorite getaway locations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following Kevin finishing his first half marathon and Sabrina passing her board exams, a 
                        getaway to their favorite place was made in October 2024. Monterey didn’t disappoint — dolphins 
                        swam by in the bay, they scored the best lunch seats, and the day just felt sprinkled with something special.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        That evening, Kevin surprised Sabrina with a relaxing private spa, where he ended up surprising 
                        Sabrina two Sonny Angel boxes, with the best secret  item located inside… a ring! 
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        They even have the unboxing video to prove it (ask Sabrina as she’ll always have the video on deck hehe)
